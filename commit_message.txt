# Changes Summary

## Enhanced Visual Experience with Advanced Three.js Animations

1. Matrix Rain Component:
   - Added particle trails with fade effects
   - Implemented shader-based materials
   - Created staggered transition animations
   - Added particle rotation and oscillation

2. Connections and Network:
   - Added curved paths between nodes
   - Created dynamic flow animations
   - Implemented variable thickness based on relations

3. Interactive Background:
   - Added flow field dynamics with SimplexNoise
   - Enhanced particle behavior with non-linear interactions
   - Improved depth perception and parallax effects

4. Camera System:
   - Implemented cinematic paths with splines
   - Added smooth transitions between states
   - Created subtle motion effects for improved depth

5. Lighting and Visual Depth:
   - Enhanced lighting setup with colored point lights
   - Added subtle glow effects to important elements
   - Improved material properties for better depth

The site now features much more dynamic and engaging animations while maintaining
its clean, futuristic aesthetic.

Dependencies added: gsap, simplex-noise

Note: Post-processing effects are disabled in this commit pending the installation
of @react-three/postprocessing when environment issues are resolved.
